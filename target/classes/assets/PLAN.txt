✅ 1. Project Overview
Title: The CineMate — Movie Ticket Reservation
Language/Platform: Java SE 8
GUI Framework: Java Swing (via WindowBuilder in Eclipse)
Persistence: File-based or Database (preferred for login & bookings)
Minimum Feature Requirements:

CRUD operations

Receipt printing

Dynamic seat availability

Persistent storage

Simulated payment

Admin features

User login/logout

📋 2. Key Components To Implement
🔹 A. Main Forms & Navigation
Main Menu (Options Form)

Check Schedule

Check Prices

Proceed to Reservation

Log in / Log out

🔹 B. Movie System
Movie Schedule (CRUD for admins)

One cinema station (for simplicity)

Assume fixed 1-hour duration per movie

System date = booking date (no need for future booking complexity)

🔹 C. Seat Reservation
Show visual seat layout (buttons/grid)

Select available seats

Mark already-reserved seats as disabled

Cancel mid-process = discard changes

Saving must ensure seat is locked for same date & time

🔹 D. Booking Details & Confirmation
Input customer details (Name, Age, etc.)

Payment (simulated success/fail)

Save booking info

Print receipt

🔹 E. Admin Panel
Log in required

Can:

Add/Edit/Delete movie listings (CRUD)

View reservations/bookings

View user list (if needed)

💾 3. Storage Requirements
Option A: Text File-Based
movies.txt – stores movie title, date, time

seats.txt – stores reserved seats per showtime

users.txt – for login system

bookings.txt – stores finalized bookings

Option B: Database (Recommended)
users (username, password, role)

movies (title, date, time)

seats (movie_id, seat_number, status)

bookings (user_id, movie_id, seats_reserved, payment_status)

🧱 4. Required Classes (OOP Design)
Class Name	Responsibility
MainApp	Entry point, handles navigation
Movie	Model for movie data
MovieManager	CRUD operations on movie
User	Model for user
UserManager	Handles login/logout, registration
Seat	Represents a seat
SeatManager	Logic for availability, reserving
Booking	Stores booking info
BookingManager	Creates, saves, loads bookings
PaymentProcessor	Simulates payment
ReceiptPrinter	Prints receipt to file or console
Database (if DB used)	Handles DB connection & queries

🖼️ 5. GUI Forms (with Swing / WindowBuilder)
Form Name	Contents
MainMenuForm	Navigation buttons
ScheduleForm	Movie schedule display
PricesForm	Price list display
ReservationForm	Seat layout, movie selector
UserDetailsForm	Input name, age, etc.
PaymentForm	Simulated payment
ReceiptForm	Shows and prints receipt
AdminLoginForm	Login credentials
AdminPanelForm	CRUD movies + view bookings

💡 6. Other Technical Notes
Seat Layout: Use a grid of JButtons; disable if taken.

Persistence: Use file read/write or SQLite/MySQL.

Simulated Payment: Simple if/else dialog box.

Receipt Printing: Can write to .txt file using PrintWriter.

Cancel Behavior: Use temp storage; discard if canceled.

Booking Locking: Compare against current reserved seats.

🚧 7. Challenges & Solutions (From Proposal)
Challenge	Solution
Designing UI	Design per form (1 screen at a time)
Dynamic Seat Avail.	Use arrays/DB + disable reserved seats
Input Validation	Use try-catch, JOptionPane errors
Payment Sim	Mock logic with message boxes
Data Loss	Save data on file/database exit
Advance Booking	Skip; use system date only (per instruction)

📌 8. Minimum Output Requirements
